Public repo for 10-202 Homework 1.

Homeworks are delivered as Python notebooks. You may choose to use either the
Jupyter (`hw2.ipynb`) or [marimo](https://docs.marimo.io) (`hw2_marimo.py`)
notebook.

Both notebooks can be implemented locally. If you prefer to use an online
hosted notebook, you can use one of the following online notebooks, depending
on whether you choose to use Jupyter or marimo:

* Jupyter: https://colab.research.google.com/github/modernaicourse/hw2/blob/main/hw2.ipynb
* marimo: https://molab.marimo.io/github/modernaicourse/hw2/blob/main/hw2_marimo.py
